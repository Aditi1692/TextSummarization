health care system finance money people to less healthy ill sort disease than people regularly healthy
exception elderly youth
every health insurance america provide free clinical check ups family single household
medicare/medicaid equal people income time affordable
insurance company make co-payment based upon yearly household income
help people actually staying current health
get flex card much money yearly able pay least prescription
when prescribed drug doctor have bar code scan get refilled conveniently while getting prescription filled at drug store way pharmacist monitor drug getting and how much
physician evaluate and give tip people say problem with certain issue before automatically diagnose them with disease causing them to take medicine that can become dependent on and start abuse
people with chronic illness have specialist with reasonable price so physician monitor health efficiently
doctor physician have small pharmacist convenient for patient get prescription refilled
physician need go seminar and small course to stay current on new thing in health world and type disease detected lately less misdiagnosing occurs
emergency room visit less expensive pharmacy. small clinic with reasonable price emergency less severe hospital attention for anyone with or without insurance
nursing home covered by medicare since elderly don't have family afford need loved one monitored
government could pull money going healthcare system and country would build back by people helping each other
people with chronic illness seek medical attention need no matter financial situation
drug generic have brand offered so people won't pay much medicine they need
birth control be free pregnancy decrease and medicaid won't provide person and unborn child
seeing dietician or nutritionist be free at least a year maybe cut back on visiting primary doctor so much because natural health sufficient and less likely get ill
universal healthcare system insurance company big problem today
physician misdiagnosing patient happening often physician evaluated regulary to reduces risk
woman clinic readily available awareness prevent disease/cancers
able visit specialist with reasonable price also help long run illness could improve or caught early before worsens and less trip to physician could possibly not know what wrong
physician pay attention figuring cause of particular problem rather prescribing drug to alleviate symptom money gone to drug and illness not cured
think people having mental illness be able to see doctor or specialist at reasonable cost
true because sometimes money for drug could result in substance abuse for certain case
exactly saving time money without wasting resource government has supplied
agree because ultimately woman decides whether have baby and risk go along
seeing dietician/nutritionist also give person better picture of their health and improve to avoid going doctor
agree feel unemployed or no intention of getting job may issue paying
think emergency room visit be free. emergency is one actual concern. Not emergency involving headache stomach problem could be solved with counter medication but rather emergency involving deep cut or severe infection
agree would make system efficient without sending people away who actually need it also could get better tab on substance being used and doctor tell patient abusing substance
think every hospital clinic offer health care because people can't always get specific provider they listed in their insurance. they could also need serious medical attention and not able to get affordable price
also mentally ill/disabled
maybe they could also get coupon or card allowing them to get discounted visit to doctor or see specialist
true they won't wasting money on false diagnosis. would also make system reliable to public knowing doctor stay current disease and  symptom
healthcare system must changed feature healthcare cost reduced as it help low income or unemployed people family to afford. obama care forced bring best health care service to everybody regardless ability to pay hospital bill education system doctor specialist practitioner be deep educated and good trained to give best service to patient and their family and I think this part is okay. In order to save time money medical technology be given and improve to give best health care service patient. example like use robot instead of doctor to do surgery using new invented radiology scanner to reduce radio way uv ray ultrasound wave etc. everybody be given equal health care service as cost be low like canada australia. insurance in obama care people must obtain regardless they never get sick although may affect health service but people have option taking care health efficiency. moreover education teach doctor physician specialist nurse or people working in healthcare that patient health is important than anything else instead taking insurance make fast diagnostic. looking this aspect because many doctor physician specialist nurse pay attention to particular topic. medicine be lowered in price as in generic medication everybody afford buy though they have insurance may help people taking care health. lastly maintaining good health in best way to make live better and don't need to get healthcare service every time get sick unless getting old and need people take care
agree because woman need to be treated fairly as men and aspect like age gender sexuality education family background etc
think generic be get off to let main one reduce in cost
would reduce cost of prescribed drug then people would be able to afford well oppurtunity to actually buy medication they need to take on regular basis
clinic similar to open Care-Now be family medicine doctor misdiagnosing be less likely to occur and prescribing drug less likely to happen
physician be monitored on prescribing to patient because this may crack getting certain drug promotional purpose and receiving thing from drug company would normally not get if were not prescribing drug. money in case doctor really not considered patient health
less immunization might help people to actually be able to fight disease that they trying prevent coming back since new one introduced all time
study go in looking at pattern and trend of certain outbreak globally and try to figure way prevent continuously spreading
HIV/AIDS patient get coupon on medication and also affordable specialized doctor to visit for regular check-ups also used process trying to find cure for disease
restriction be placed on receiving medicaid so people lazy and really want to rely on government help will less likely get it
pharmacy with local doctor or physician to conveniently get medication and check-up time
another thing to mention from previous post disable people HIV/AIDS patient etc serious disease must be treated fairly and appropriate to normal people or may better because even weaker and depress for along time may be whole life even with mental physical or social health. lgbt community also need to be treated equally to people regardless race age background etc And this task of health care provider are responsible in providing best quality health service. people in nursing home be suffered many problem and can't get away aging need good care even mental physical social health treatment to make enjoy rest of life. health care show or program many health issue commercial to everyone to make announcement or warning thing related to health like overdosing street drug eating habitat passive life style unhealthy behavior smoking drinking std hiv thread etc. many many case of rape related healthcare system needs law restriction rule to reduce issue as guaranteed good working environment to all healthcare employee
yes not all people like what you say. know many people lazy and dependence but are also people get really sick and serious illness cannot afford pay for medication health issue
agree need to get better health service and even though saving time and money
agree although healthcare cover most thing specialized area not to be neglected and also recieve same ammount of care than amount given in general healthcare

regular check ups physician be required to make sure they still have moral and value and really care patient rather than paycheck
new technology would also reduce amount of time surgery would or regular everyday visit would take also with new thing coming seminar be displayed so doctor have a chance of purchasing
support group for people chronically ill be provided by government so better chance of thriving in life and other people suffer but help each other live healthier lifestyle to try and relieve pain and maybe even live longer
Medicare/Medicaid would crack down system and actually administer to people need it then taxes would probably go down because government would not put much money towards on healthcare system
assistant living for elderly be affordable so nursing home not be crowded because elderly people resort to nursing home since all they're insurance cover
maintaining good healthcare system key reason maybe government really evaluate area one
budget healthcare service reducing need considered increase amount money citizen healthy mean country also healthy new research health science encouraged granted government foundation help young new scientist find new method better cure patient even whole healthcare system working hard many people complaining healthcare insurance medicare medicaid ha social benefit qualify getting enough financial support must new hospital build server enough increasing patient old one insufficient doe whole service specialist nurse violate policy rule must charged based scale error make healthcare service good model others obey minimize error little zero
agree even people cheat get free benefit
healthcare service business people insured get best service pay receive
would great people way busy working life need quick fast service serve many people done well
yes agree would also reduce fund required care much funding go actually care
method sound pretty solid opinion problem sometimes sick people anticipated enough healthcare deal amount sickness presented
technology grows advanced day day point going way monitor truly need healthcare hopefully people necessary thing get help need get track becoming healthier time also enough medication staff deal need healthcare without staff supply healthcare decrease people remain sick die rate technology evolving already system unfortunately everyone trusted medication help staff provides
difficult draw line fit emergency visit free completely probably reasonable cost instead
think medical research big factor providing adequate healthcare funding available researcher find cure disease new technique procedure new drug way prevent illness
think pharmacy physician together really make much difference important thing making convenient patient drive pharmacy rather fit physician pharmacist instead
agree technology advance job opportunity people without job leading le dependent people healthcare
agree research towards disease one main source healthcare cure discovered give people ill live healthy life get back foot
